# World Weather Analysis

The purpose of this project was to use Google APIs to plot ideal travel itineraries based on weather conditions and hotel availability in cities around the world. Initially, we pulled weather data from random cities across the globe. Then we found which of those cities were traveler-friendly, i.e. had hotels to stay at. 
Finally we found four cities which fit all the parameters and which were close to each other in geographical proximity. We used Google Maps to plot directions between these cities, and created a travel itinerary for our lovely travel clients. 

Although there are probably better ways to determine ideal travel itineraries, the applications from this project could certain be useful in ruling out destinations.
